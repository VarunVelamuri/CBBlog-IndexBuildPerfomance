Factors affecting index build performance

Some of the key factors that are affecting index build performance are:
	a. Projector/Indexer CPU -> If projector CPU is saturated, then processing incoming
	mutations will be delayed and this can cause the slow-down the indexer build. Similarly,
	if indexer CPU is saturated, then updating the book-keeping and pushing it to storage
	subsystem can get delayed and therefore cause build slow-down
	b. Indexer RSS - If the memory utilisation of the indexer process exceeds the quota, then
	the in-memory page will be evicted and flushed to disk. If a look-up needs to be performed,
	then there will be a disk read. Depending on the disk I/O saturation, this can drastically
	slow down index build

There are many other factors like network bandwidth, projector memory, size of indexed key, index definition
that will contribute to index build performance but they can be ignored for the current performance characterization
