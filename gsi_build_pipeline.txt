Overview of GSI build pipeline

At a high level, the index build pipeline can be categorised in 3 stages:
	a. Processing at projector
	b. Book-keeping at indexer
	c. Read/ writes from storage subsystem

Projector processes running the the KV node establishes data streams with KV
for all the buckets on which indexes are defined for. Additionally, projector
keeps a track of all the index definitions on each of the indexer nodes. For
each mutation that is streamed from KV, projector evaluates the incoming
mutation against all the indexes, extracts the secondary keys as per the index
definition, encodes the extraced data and sends it to indexer.

After indexer receives the encoded data for each of the index, the book-keeping
layer will update the book-keeping to handle scenarios like service restart,
scans etc. The encoded key is then pushed to storage subsystem. Based on the type
of storage sub-system, the encoded indexed data is either kept completely in-memory
(or) will be distributed between both memory and disk.
