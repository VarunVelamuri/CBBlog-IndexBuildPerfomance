What is the difference between initial traffic and incremental traffic?

Indexer maintains sepearate streams for initial build and incremental build.

Initial build refers to the case where the mutations are streamead from data service starting
from the first mutation. Incremental traffic builds on top of initial stream

What can happen in initial stream?
	a. First snap optimization
	b. But there can be updates as well in initial stream

So, initial build and initial traffic are not the same 



Note: Initial build can contain some incrmental traffic as well
