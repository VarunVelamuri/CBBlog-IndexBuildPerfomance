What is the difference between initial traffic and incremental traffic?

Talk about stremaing from KV with initial vs incremental traffic and 
incremental traffic requires back-index look-up

The data service has MVCC with append only writes. So, any mutation will be appended
to the existing snapshot as delta snapshot. This means that the first snapshot that
indexer recives will not contain any previous infomation. This is referred to as initial traffic.

Any mutations 
So, initial build and initial traffic are not the same.

Note: Initial build can contain some incrmental traffic as well
