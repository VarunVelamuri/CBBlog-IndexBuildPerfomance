Initial vs Incremental traffic

The data being streamed from KV node can be classified into initial traffic and
incremental traffic. Initial traffic refers to the case where the data streamed
from KV belongs to the first snapshot on the KV node. As KV node maintains an 
immutable view of unique keys, the first snapshot is guaraneed to have no updates
and therefore, there is no need to read form back-index. Just updating back index
with the key value pair is sufficient.

The data streamed from KV after the first snapshot is being refereed to as incremental
traffic. During incremental traffic, the back index is read, the value of the docID
updated and the corresponding entry in main-index is updated as well.


When indexer enters DGM (Data-Greater than-Memory), then this back-index look-up during
incremental traffic requires reading a page from disk and this can potentially slow down index build
