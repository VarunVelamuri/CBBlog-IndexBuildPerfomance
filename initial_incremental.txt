What is the difference between initial traffic and incremental traffic?

Indexer maintains sepearate streams for initial build and incremental build.

Any index build starting from scratch is referred to as initial index build. After the 
mutations in the index catchup with all the mutations of the bucket, then the index will be
merged into incremental stream

Initial build refers to the case where the mutations are streamead from data service starting
from the first mutation. Incremental traffic builds on top of initial stream

What can happen in initial stream?
	a. First snap optimization
	b. But there can be updates as well in initial stream

So, initial build and initial traffic are not the same 

Note: Initial build can contain some incrmental traffic as well
