This page conatins multiple title options for the couchbase blog article:

a. Performance evaluation of insert heavy workloads under DGM scenario
	1. Need to explain about back-index lookup problem
	2. Explain about bloom filters and how there are used for optimizing insert heavy workload
		i)  Bloom filters are only applicable for incremental traffic and not initial traffic
	        ii) Therefore, there is a need to explain initial vs incremental traffic

	-> Since, we are defining initial vs incremental traffic, there is no need to keep this article
	tightly bound to insert heavy work loads

b. Performance characterization of Global secondary index build pipeline 
	1. What do we try to explain? 
		i)  How indexer manages storage engine?
		ii) What is the difference between initial and incremental traffic 
	2. What happens during an insert/update operation

	-> I would organize the flow as follows: 
		=> Explain GSI build pipeline in brief -> From projector to storage engine. In this section itself we define
		initial vs incremental traffic -> Indexer maintains separate streams for initial and incremental traffic
		=> Storage management by indexer -> Explain the main and back index problems, how initial traffic is handled,
		how incremental traffic is handled etc.
		=> Where will this come?

c. Performance characterization on Global Seconday index build pipeline
	<Some introduction on GSI>
	<Overview of GSI build pipleline>
		<KV> -> <Projector> -> <Indexer> -> <Storage Engine>
	<Storage layer management by GSI>
		<Main index>
		<back index>
		<Handling updates>
	<Initial vs incremental traffic>
		<Explain about snapshot streaming from KV>
		<Any mutation whose seqno is a part of the first snapshot is considered initial traffic>
		<During incremental traffic, back index loop has to be performed which can impact build performance>

	<Performance evaluation of initial index builds>
	<Performance evaluation of incremental index builds>
